Welcome to the documentation for openNDS
========================================

openNDS (a short form of "open Network Demarcation Service") is a high performance, small footprint, Captive Portal.

It provides a border control gateway between a public local area network and the Internet, offering by default a simple splash page restricted Internet connection, yet incorporates an API that allows the creation of sophisticated authentication applications.

It is a fork of the NoDogSplash project that in turn was derived originally from the codebase of the Wifi Guard Dog project.

openNDS is released under the GNU General Public License.
